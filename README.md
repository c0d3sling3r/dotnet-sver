# dotnet-sver
A CLI application for adjusting C# projects' versions using semantic principles.

Generally semantic versioning has three main parts. *MAJOR*, *MINOR* and *PATCH* and represents with the following template: X.Y.Z which X holds the *MAJOR* part, Y holds the *MINOR* and Z holds the *PATCH*.

It also supports pre-release and build versions which will be appended to X.Y.Z. 

> For more information, I refer you to [here](https://semver.org/).

# Getting Started
## Installation
***
Install from the universal source:
```shell
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-sver
```

Build locally and install:
```shell
cd src
cd SemanticVersioning.Net.Cli
dotnet pack -c Release -o nupkg
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-sver --add-source .\nupkg
```

## Usage
***
First, your cwd(current working directory) must be somewhere inside your solution directory.
```shell
cd <somewhere-inside-yout-target-solution>
```

### *LISTING:* `dotnet-sver list`

By executing this command, your projects and their versions will be printed out.

```shell
$ dotnet-sver list
1) Project-1.csproj [version]
2) Project-2.csproj [version]
3) Project-3.csproj [version]
4) Project-4.csproj [version]
5) Project-5.csproj [version]
```
  
### *UPGRADING:* `dotnet-sver upgrade`
 
*Options:*

- `--project-number` or `-p`: specifying the project targeting for upgrading.
- `--all` or `-a`: upgrades all the projects inside the solution.
  > Obviously, there should be either -p or -a in the command.
- `--major`: upgrades the X part of the version.
- `--minor`: upgrades the Y part of the version.
- `--patch`: upgrades the Z part of the version.

There are two ways of upgrading the projects: 
- By specifying the project number printing in `dotnet-sver list` result using `--project-number` or `-p` option.
  ```shell
  $ dotnet-sver upgrade -p <project-number> [version-part-option]
  
  # For instance, the following command, upgrades the Z part of the version of the project number #3:
  $ dotnet-sver upgrade -p 3 --patch 
  ```
- And *IF* you want to upgrade all the versions of the all projects, you can pass `-a` or `--all` option.
  ```shell
  $ dotnet-sver upgrade -a [version-part-option]
  
  # For instance, the following command, upgrades the Y part of the version of the all projects.
  $ dotnet-sver upgrade -a --minor 
  ```
  
### *DEGRADING:* `dotnet-sver degrade`
 
*Options:*

- `--project-number` or `-p`: specifying the project targeting for degrading.
- `--all` or `-a`: degrades all the projects inside the solution.
  > Obviously, there should be either -p or -a in the command.
- `--major`: degrades the X part of the version.
- `--minor`: degrades the Y part of the version.
- `--patch`: degrades the Z part of the version.

There are two ways of degrading the projects: 
- By specifying the project number printing in `dotnet-sver list` result using `--project-number` or `-p` option.
  ```shell
  $ dotnet-sver degrade -p <project-number> [version-part-option]
  
  # For instance, the following command, degrades the Z part of the version of the project number #3:
  $ dotnet-sver degrade -p 3 --patch 
  ```
- And *IF* you want to degrade all the versions of the all projects, you can pass `-a` or `--all` option.
  ```shell
  $ dotnet-sver degrade -a [version-part-option]
  
  # For instance, the following command, degrades the Y part of the version of the all projects.
  $ dotnet-sver degrade -a --minor 
  ```
  
### *SETTING EXPLICITLY:* `dotnet-sver set`
Maybe you'll be more comfortable to set the versions explicitly. I have your back ðŸ˜Ž. Use the magical `set` command.
 
*Options:*

- `--project-number` or `-p`: specifying the project targeting for upgrading.
- `--all` or `-a`: degrades all the projects inside the solution.
  > Obviously, there should be either -p or -a in the command.

There are two ways of setting the projects: 
- By specifying the project number printing in `dotnet-sver list` result using `--project-number` or `-p` option.
  ```shell
  $ dotnet-sver degrade -p <project-number> [version-part-option]
  
  # For instance, the following command, degrades the Z part of the version of the project number #3:
  $ dotnet-sver degrade -p 3 --patch 
  ```
- And *IF* you want to degrade all the versions of the all projects, you can pass `-a` or `--all` option.
  ```shell
  $ dotnet-sver degrade -a [version-part-option]
  
  # For instance, the following command, degrades the Y part of the version of the all projects.
  $ dotnet-sver degrade -a --minor 
  ```
